DIP Mini Project: Noise Removal using Median Filter
🔍 Problem Statement
This project demonstrates the removal of salt-and-pepper noise from grayscale images using a Median Filter.

📷 Input
A real-world grayscale image (e.g., scanned document or CCTV image).

🧪 Noise Simulation
Salt and pepper noise is added with 5% probability.

🧼 Denoising Technique
We apply OpenCV's medianBlur() with a kernel size of 3.

📊 Evaluation Metrics
PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio)
SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)
📁 Outputs
outputs/noisy_image.jpg
outputs/denoised_image.jpg
✅ Results
PSNR: 28.12 dB
SSIM: 0.9021
